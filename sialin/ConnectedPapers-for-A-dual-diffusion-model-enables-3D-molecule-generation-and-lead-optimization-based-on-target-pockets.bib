abstract = {The generation of 3D molecules requires simultaneously deciding the categorical features~(atom types) and continuous features~(atom coordinates). Deep generative models, especially Diffusion Models (DMs), have demonstrated effectiveness in generating feature-rich geometries. However, existing DMs typically suffer from unstable probability dynamics with inefficient sampling speed. In this paper, we introduce geometric flow matching, which enjoys the advantages of both equivariant modeling and stabilized probability dynamics. More specifically, we propose a hybrid probability path where the coordinates probability path is regularized by an equivariant optimal transport, and the information between different modalities is aligned. Experimentally, the proposed method could consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks with 4.75$\times$ speed up of sampling on average.},

abstract = {Motivation: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently taken the field of generative modeling by storm, pioneering new state-of-the-art results in disciplines such as computer vision and computational biology for diverse tasks ranging from text-guided image generation to structure-guided protein design. Along this latter line of research, methods have recently been proposed for generating 3D molecules using equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) within a DDPM framework. However, such methods are unable to learn important geometric and physical properties of 3D molecules during molecular graph generation, as they adopt molecule-agnostic and non-geometric GNNs as their 3D graph denoising networks, which negatively impacts their ability to effectively scale to datasets of large 3D molecules. Results: In this work, we address these gaps by introducing the Geometry-Complete Diffusion Model (GCDM) for 3D molecule generation, which outperforms existing 3D molecular diffusion models by significant margins across conditional and unconditional settings for the QM9 dataset as well as for the larger GEOM-Drugs dataset. Importantly, we demonstrate that the geometry-complete denoising process GCDM learns for 3D molecule generation allows the model to generate realistic and stable large molecules at the scale of GEOM-Drugs, whereas previous methods fail to do so with the features they learn. Additionally, we show that extensions of GCDM can not only effectively design 3D molecules for specific protein pockets but also that GCDM's geometric features can effectively be repurposed to directly optimize the geometry and chemical composition of existing 3D molecules for specific molecular properties, demonstrating new, real-world versatility of molecular diffusion models.

abstract = {Structure-based generative chemistry aims to explore much bigger chemical space to design a ligand with high binding affinity to the target proteins; it is a critical step in de novo computer-aided drug discovery. Traditional in silico methods suffer from calculation inefficiency and the performances of existing machine learning methods could be bottlenecked by the auto-regressive sampling strategy. To address these concerns, we herein have developed a novel conditional deep generative model, PMDM, for 3D molecule generation fitting specified target proteins. PMDM incorporates a dual equivariant diffusion model framework to leverage the local and global molecular dynamics to generate 3D molecules in a one-shot fashion. By considering the conditioned protein semantic information and spatial information, PMDM is able to generate chemically and conformationally valid molecules which suitably fit pocket holes. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate that PMDM can generate drug-like, synthesis-accessible, novel, and high-binding affinity molecules targeting specific proteins, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in terms of multiple evaluation metrics. In addition, we perform chemical space analysis for generated molecules and lead compound optimization for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) by only utilizing three atoms as the seed fragment. The experimental results implicate that the structures of generated molecules are rational compared to the reference molecules, and PMDM can generate massive bioactive molecules highly binding to the targeted proteins which are not included in the training set.},

abstract = {Rich data and powerful machine learning models allow us to design drugs for a specific protein target \textit{in silico}. Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining.},

Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model, DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules, we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance in the sampling phase. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties and conformational stability, with up to -8.39 Avg.

Because the molecules are governed by physical laws, a key challenge is to incorporate prior information into the training procedure to generate high-quality and realistic molecules. We propose a simple and novel approach to steer the training of diffusion-based generative models with physical and statistics prior information. This is achieved by constructing physically informed diffusion bridges, stochastic processes that guarantee to yield a given observation at the fixed terminal time. We develop a Lyapunov function based method to construct and determine bridges, and propose a number of proposals of informative prior bridges for both high-quality molecule generation and uniformity-promoted 3D point cloud generation. With comprehensive experiments, we show that our method provides a powerful approach to the 3D generation task, yielding molecule structures with better quality and stability scores and more uniformly distributed point clouds of high qualities.},

However, their utility is still limited by suboptimal performance on large molecular structures and limited training data. To address this gap, we explore the design space of E(3)-equivariant diffusion models, focusing on previously unexplored areas. Our extensive comparative analysis evaluates the interplay between continuous and discrete state spaces. From this investigation, we present the EQGAT-diff model, which consistently outperforms established models for the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. Significantly, EQGAT-diff takes continuous atom positions, while chemical elements and bond types are categorical and uses time-dependent loss weighting, substantially increasing training convergence, the quality of generated samples, and inference time. We also showcase that including chemically motivated additional features like hybridization states in the diffusion process enhances the validity of generated molecules. To further strengthen the applicability of diffusion models to limited training data, we investigate the transferability of EQGAT-diff trained on the large PubChem3D dataset with implicit hydrogen atoms to target different data distributions. Fine-tuning EQGAT-diff for just a few iterations shows an efficient distribution shift, further improving performance throughout data sets. Finally, we test our model on the Crossdocked data set for structure-based de novo ligand generation, underlining the importance of our findings showing state-of-the-art performance on Vina docking scores.},

A new thread of works have shown the great potential in advancing the specificity and success rate of in silico drug design by considering the structure of protein pockets. This setting posts fundamental computational challenges in sampling new chemical compounds that could satisfy multiple geometrical constraints imposed by pockets. Previous sampling algorithms either sample in the graph space or only consider the 3D coordinates of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical structures such as bond types and functional groups. To address the challenge, we develop Pocket2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant generative network composed of two modules: 1) a new graph neural network capturing both spatial and bonding relationships between atoms of the binding pockets and 2) a new efficient algorithm which samples new drug candidates conditioned on the pocket representations from a tractable distribution without relying on MCMC.

abstract = {Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in designing novel chemical compounds with desirable pharmaceutical properties. In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem -- generating a small"linker"to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, there are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D coordinates of all the atoms.},

Although deep generative models and geometric deep learning have made great progress in drug design, existing works either sample in the 2D graph space or fail to generate valid molecules with realistic substructures. To tackle these problems, we propose a Fragmentbased LigAnd Generation framework (FLAG), to generate 3D molecules with valid and realistic substructures fragment-by-fragment. In FLAG, a motif vocabulary is constructed by extracting common molecular fragments (i.e., motif) in the dataset. At each generation step, a 3D graph neural network is first employed to encode the intermediate context information. Then, our model selects the focal motif, predicts the next motif type, and attaches the new motif. The bond lengths/angles can be quickly and accurately determined by cheminformatics tools. Finally, the molecular geometry is further adjusted according to the predicted rotation angle and the structure refinement. Our model not only achieves competitive performances on conventional metrics such as binding affinity, QED, and SA, but also outperforms baselines by a large margin in generating molecules with realistic substructures.

abstract = {Generating molecules with high binding affinities to target proteins (a.k.a. structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different. Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS for generalizable structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs. Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule generation scheme are used to improve the model's performance. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms baselines in generating realistic drug candidates with high affinities in challenging out-of-distribution settings.},

Most of them are atom-level-based methods, which consider atoms as basic components and generate atom positions and types.

To solve this, we propose D3FG, a functional-group-based diffusion model for pocket-specific molecule generation and elaboration. D3FG decomposes molecules into two categories of components: functional groups defined as rigid bodies and linkers as mass points. And the two kinds of components can together form complicated fragments that enhance ligand-protein interactions. To be specific, in the diffusion process, D3FG diffuses the data distribution of the positions, orientations, and types of the components into a prior distribution; In the generative process, the noise is gradually removed from the three variables by denoisers parameterized with designed equivariant graph neural networks. In the experiments, our method can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures, competitive affinities toward the protein targets, and better drug properties. Besides, D3FG as a solution to a new task of molecule elaboration, could generate molecules with high affinities based on existing ligands and the hotspots of target proteins.},

We have conducted comprehensive multi-view experiments to demonstrate that DiffDTM can generate drug-like, synthesis-accessible, novel, and high-binding affinity molecules targeting specific dual proteins, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in terms of multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we utilized DiffDTM to generate molecules towards dopamine receptor D2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A as new antipsychotics. The experimental results indicate that DiffDTM can be easily plugged into unseen dual targets to generate bioactive molecules, addressing the issues of requiring insufficient active molecule data for training as well as the need to retrain when encountering new targets.},

abstract = {Drug design is a crucial step in the drug discovery cycle. Recently, various deep learning-based methods design drugs by generating novel molecules from scratch, avoiding traversing large-scale drug libraries. However, they depend on scarce experimental data or time-consuming docking simulation, leading to overfitting issues with limited training data and slow generation speed. In this study, we propose the zero-shot drug design method DESERT (Drug dEsign by SkEtching and geneRaTing). Specifically, DESERT splits the design process into two stages: sketching and generating, and bridges them with the molecular shape. The two-stage fashion enables our method to utilize the large-scale molecular database to reduce the need for experimental data and docking simulation. Experiments show that DESERT achieves a new state-of-the-art at a fast speed.},

abstract = {Molecular generative models have demonstrated their potential in designing molecules from scratch with high binding affinities in a pre-determined protein pocket and could be combined with traditional structural based drug design strategy. However, the generative processes of such models are random and the atomic interaction information between ligand and protein are ignored. On the other hand, the ligand has high propensity to bind with residues called hotspots. Hotspot residues contribute to the majority of the binding free energies and have been recognized as appealing targets for designed molecules. In this work, we develop an interaction prompt guided diffusion model-InterDiff to deal with the challenges. Four kinds of atomic interactions are involved in our model and represented as learnable vector embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for each residue to guide the molecular generative process. Comprehensive in-silico experiments evince that our model could generate molecules with desired ligand-protein interactions in a guidable way. Furthermore, we validate InterDiff on two realistic protein-based therapeutic agents. Results show that InterDiff could generate molecules with better or similar binding mode compared to known targeted drugs.},

We introduce a new multimodal 3D generative model that enables shape-conditioned 3D molecular design by equivariantly encoding molecular shape and variationally encoding chemical identity. We ensure local geometric and chemical validity of generated molecules by using autoregressive fragment-based generation with heuristic bonding geometries, allowing the model to prioritize the scoring of rotatable bonds to best align the growing conformational structure to the target shape. We evaluate our 3D generative model in tasks relevant to drug design including shape-conditioned generation of chemically diverse molecular structures and shape-constrained molecular property optimization, demonstrating its utility over virtual screening of enumerated libraries.},

Additionally, the model automatically determines the number of atoms in the linker and its attachment points to the input fragments.

Inspired by the success of multi-task learning in the NLP area, we use prefix embeddings to provide a novel generative model that considers both the targeted pocket's circumstances and a variety of chemical properties. All conditional information is represented as learnable features, which the generative model subsequently employs as a contextual prompt. Experiments show that our model exhibits good controllability in both single and multi-conditional molecular generation. The controllability enables us to outperform previous structure-based drug design methods.

abstract = {Generating molecules that bind to specific proteins is an important but challenging task in drug discovery. Previous works usually generate atoms in an auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are generated one by one. However, in real-world molecular systems, the interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration, the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D coordinates of an entire molecule, with an equivariant network. Experimentally, the proposed method shows competitive performance compared with prevailing works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules.},

Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7\% improvement for the valid percentage of large biomolecules.

abstract = {Molecule generation, especially generating 3D molecular geometries from scratch (i.e., 3D de novo generation), has become a fundamental task in drug design. Existing diffusion based 3D molecule generation methods could suffer from unsatisfactory performances, especially when generating large molecules. At the same time, the generated molecules lack enough diversity. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model to address those two challenges. 

First, interatomic relations are not included in molecules' 3D point cloud representations. Thus, it is difficult for existing generative models to capture the potential interatomic forces and abundant local constraints. 
To tackle this challenge, we propose to augment the potential interatomic forces and further involve dual equivariant encoders to encode interatomic forces of different strengths.
Second, existing diffusion-based models essentially shift elements in geometry along the gradient of data density. Such a process lacks enough exploration in the intermediate steps of the Langevin dynamics. To address this issue, we introduce a distributional controlling variable in each diffusion/reverse step to enforce thorough explorations and further improve generation diversity.

Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. We also conduct case studies to help understand the physicochemical properties of the generated molecules. The codes are available at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MDM.},

abstract = {Generation of graphs is a major challenge for real-world tasks that require understanding the complex nature of their non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have achieved notable success in graph generation recently, they are ill-suited for modeling the topological properties of graphs since learning to denoise the noisy samples does not explicitly learn the graph structures to be generated. To tackle this limitation, we propose a generative framework that models the topology of graphs by explicitly learning the final graph structures of the diffusion process. Specifically, we design the generative process as a mixture of endpoint-conditioned diffusion processes which is driven toward the predicted graph that results in rapid convergence. We further introduce a simple parameterization of the mixture process and develop an objective for learning the final graph structure, which enables maximum likelihood training. Through extensive experimental validation on general graph and 2D/3D molecule generation tasks, we show that our method outperforms previous generative models, generating graphs with correct topology with both continuous (e.g. 3D coordinates) and discrete (e.g. atom types) features.

abstract = {Designing new molecules is essential for drug discovery and material science. Recently, deep generative models that aim to model molecule distribution have made promising progress in narrowing down the chemical research space and generating high-fidelity molecules. However, current generative models only focus on modeling either 2D bonding graphs or 3D geometries, which are two complementary descriptors for molecules. The lack of ability to jointly model both limits the improvement of generation quality and further downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new joint 2D and 3D diffusion model (JODO) that generates complete molecules with atom types, formal charges, bond information, and 3D coordinates. To capture the correlation between molecular graphs and geometries in the diffusion process, we develop a Diffusion Graph Transformer to parameterize the data prediction model that recovers the original data from noisy data. The Diffusion Graph Transformer interacts node and edge representations based on our relational attention mechanism, while simultaneously propagating and updating scalar features and geometric vectors. Our model can also be extended for inverse molecular design targeting single or multiple quantum properties. In our comprehensive evaluation pipeline for unconditional joint generation, the results of the experiment show that JODO remarkably outperforms the baselines on the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. Furthermore, our model excels in few-step fast sampling, as well as in inverse molecule design and molecular graph generation. Our code is provided in https://github.com/GRAPH-0/JODO.},

abstract = {We study a fundamental problem in structure-based drug design -- generating molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites. While we have witnessed the great success of deep generative models in drug design, the existing methods are mostly string-based or graph-based. They are limited by the lack of spatial information and thus unable to be applied to structure-based design tasks. Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules interact with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D protein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our model estimates the probability density of atom's occurrences in 3D space -- positions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher probability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling scheme -- atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until there is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model can generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various structure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker design. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from our model exhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and good drug properties such as drug-likeness even if the model is not explicitly optimized for them.},

To generate truly novel molecules that may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery, more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary.

Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional generation by utilizing the gradients from a property predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to high-scoring regions according to target properties such as protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet trivial ones. We experimentally validate that MOOD is able to explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution, generating molecules that outscore ones found with existing methods, and even the top 0.01% of the original training pool.

abstract = {Generating desirable molecular structures in 3D is a fundamental problem for drug discovery. Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for 3D non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e.~HierDiff) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained fragments are then assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HierDiff consistently improves the quality of molecule generation over existing methods},

abstract = {Abstract Designing 3D molecules with high binding affinity for specific protein targets is crucial in drug design. One challenge is that the atomic interaction between molecules and proteins in 3D space has to be taken into account. However, the existing target-aware methods solely model the joint distribution between the molecules and proteins, disregarding the binding affinities between them, which leads to limited performance. In this paper, we propose an explainable diffusion model to generate molecules that can be bound to a given protein target with high affinity. Our method explicitly incorporates the chemical knowledge of protein–ligand binding affinity into the diffusion model, and uses the knowledge to guide the denoising process towards the direction of high binding affinity. Specifically, an SE(3)-invariant expert network is developed to fit the Vina scoring functions and jointly trained with the denoising network, while the domain knowledge is distilled and conveyed from Vina functions to the expert network. An effective guidance is proposed on both continuous atom coordinates and discrete atom types by taking advantages of the gradient of the expert network. Experiments on the benchmark CrossDocked2020 demonstrate the superiority of our method. Additionally, an atom-level explanation of the generated molecules is provided, and the connections with the domain knowledge are established.},

abstract = {We study a fundamental problem in structure-based drug design — generating molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites. While we have witnessed the great success of deep generative models in drug design, the existing methods are mostly string-based or graph-based. They are limited by the lack of spatial information and thus unable to be applied to structure-based design tasks. Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules interact with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D protein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our model estimates the probability density of atom’s occurrences in 3D space — positions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher probability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling scheme — atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until there is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model can generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various structure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker design. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from our model exhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and good drug properties such as drug-likeness even if the model is not explicitly optimized for them.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in drug discovery is to design molecules that bind to specific proteins. To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D molecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and locations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we first employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically informative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such context includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps. Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables of interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them. Experiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules with binding ability to target protein binding sites.
