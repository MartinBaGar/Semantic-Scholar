# Identification of a vesicular aspartate transporter

Abstract: Aspartate is an excitatory amino acid that is costored with glutamate in synaptic vesicles of hippocampal neurons and synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) of pinealocytes and is exocytosed and stimulates neighboring cells by binding to specific cell receptors. Although evidence increasingly supports the occurrence of aspartergic neurotransmission, this process is still debated because the mechanism for the vesicular storage of aspartate is unknown. Here, we show that sialin, a lysosomal H+/sialic acid cotransporter, is present in hippocampal synaptic vesicles and pineal SLMVs. RNA interference of sialin expression decreased exocytosis of aspartate and glutamate in pinealocytes. Proteoliposomes containing purified sialin actively accumulated aspartate and glutamate to a similar extent when inside positive membrane potential is imposed as the driving force. Sialin carrying a mutation found in people suffering from Salla disease (R39C) was completely devoid of aspartate and glutamate transport activity, although it retained appreciable H+/sialic acid cotransport activity. These results strongly suggest that sialin possesses dual physiological functions and acts as a vesicular aspartate/glutamate transporter. It is possible that people with Salla disease lose aspartergic (and also the associated glutamatergic) neurotransmission, and this could provide an explanation for why Salla disease causes severe neurological defects.

# Salla disease in Turkish children: severe and conventional type.

Abstract: Sialic acid storage disorder, known as Salla disease, is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder produced by a defect of a proton-driven carrier that is responsible for the efflux of sialic acid from the lysosomal compartment. We report two patients with Salla disease: a two-year-old girl, presented with hypotonia, inability to speak and walk, bilateral optic atrophies, defective myelination, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who was classified as intermediate severe Salla disease; and a four-year-old girl, presented with relatively late-onset, slight hypotonia, and delayed language and mobility development, and supported by relatively protected MRI findings, who was classified as conventional Salla disease. Diagnosis of Salla disease was confirmed by accumulation of sialic acid in fibroblast culture: 15.1 and 13.2 nmol/mg protein in the first and second patient, respectively. Optic atrophy observed in the first case may be an additional feature besides the characteristic manifestations of Salla disease.

# Molecular pathogenesis of sialic acid storage diseases: insight gained from four missense mutations and a putative polymorphism of human sialin

Abstract: Background information. Free sialic acid storage diseases are caused by mutations of a lysosomal sialic acid transporter called sialin. We showed recently that the milder clinical form, Salla disease, and a related non‐Finish case, are characterized by residual transport, whereas sialin mutants found in lethal infantile cases are inactive. In the present study, we have characterized the molecular effects of a putative polymorphism (M316I) and of four pathogenic mutations associated with either infantile (G127E and R57C) or Salla‐like (G409E) phenotypes, or both (G328E). The transport activity of human sialin was analysed using a novel assay that was based on a construct without the functional lysosomal sorting motif, which is expressed at the plasma membrane.

# Two cases of Salla disease in Danish children

Abstract: Sir, Salla disease (SD), a neuro-degenerative lysosomal storage disorder, was first described by Aula et al. (1) in 1979. The disease is most common in Finland (nearly 100 patients) and Sweden (27 patients) (2). The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The defective gene, SLC17A5, is coding for the lysosomal free sialic acid transporter (Sialin). Free sialic acid accumulates in lysosomes and is excreted in excessive amounts in the urine (3). Most children with SD are asymptomatic at birth. Motor retardation, hypotonia, truncal and limb ataxia are often seen between the ages of 4 and 12 mo. During the second year of life it becomes obvious that the children are psychomotor retarded, and some have already developed spasticity, most markedly in the lower extremities. There is abnormal speech development, dysarthria, and dyspraxia. The progression of symptoms is slow, and life span is close to normal, with an IQ of 20–40 (1–3). Repeated findings on MRI are abnormal hyperintensity of the subcortical white matter in the cerebrum (indicating defective myelination), and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Cortical and cerebellar atrophy is usually present in severe cases (4). Cerebellar hypomyelination has been reported (5, 6). The patients reported on are two Danish siblings of healthy non-consanguineous parents with no known Finnish forbears—a girl born in 1989, and a boy born in 1999; in between there were two other healthy siblings. The girl, now 13 y of age, was born after an uneventful pregnancy. There were no neonatal problems. She was referred when 8 mo old and found to be hypotonic with ataxic movements of the head and arms and having weak deep tendon reflexes. From the age of 2 y she gradually developed spasticity, most markedly in the lower extremities, and from the age of 4 y in the upper extremities. At 5 y of age she was able to pull herself into a sitting position and showed improved controlled head movements. The girl’s vocabulary comprised about eight words and she understood short messages. At 7 y of age she had a generalized seizure, but there were no later convulsions, and no anticonvulsive therapy was given. At the age of 121⁄2 y puberty development had begun. Head and length was 2SD (52 cm and 137 cm), weight 3SD (25.7 kg). There was spasticity in the hands, elbows, feet and knees; the girl never learned to crawl or walk. Although she had lost the ability to speak words, she still had a good understanding of spoken language and had good socioemotional communication. A thorough neurometabolic screening showed normal urinary amino acids, urinary organic acids, lysosomal enzymes, creatinkinase, myoglobin, carnitin, acetylcholine receptor antibodies, nerve conduction velocity, muscle biopsy, very-longchain fatty acids, phytanic acid, lactate and pyruvate. There were no vacuolated blood lymphocytes at the age of 8 mo. Ophthalmological examination, hearing, brain stem audiometric and cerebral CTs were normal and, initially, an EEG test was normal. At the age of 71⁄2, EEG showed diffuse slow activity (2–3 Hz) and spike focus, but not low voltage. Cerebral MRI showed extensive lack of myelination of the cerebral hemispheres, lack of myelination of the cerebellum, thin corpus callosum, brain stem and vermis cerebelli atrophy, and some atrophy of the cerebrum. The girl’s clinical condition was considered to be quite stable, but d spite all efforts a diagnosis was not made. The family meanwhile had had two other healthy children, but the fourth child was referred at 6 mo of age and found to be hypotonic with delayed motor development. At 11⁄2 y of age his symptoms and MRI resembled those of his sister, and led to a renewed search for an inherited disease. At the age of 13 and 3 years, respectively, urinary free sialic acids were found to be elevated (examined by thin-layer chromatography) in both siblings. Genetic analyses of the girl (performed in The Netherlands) showed the Finnish founder mutation (R39C) on one allele and a nonsense mutation (W240X) n the other allele. The clinical severity supported a genotype–phenotype correlation, the heterozygote founder mutation causing a milder phenotype and the compound heterozygote often a more severe one (3). The MRI was consistent with the severity, including l ck of myelination of the cerebellum (5). Diagnosis in children with psychomotor retardation can be difficult to make, and rare inherited diseases might be left underdiagnosed. We recommend urine or cultured fibroblast tests for free sialic acid in children with psychomotor retardation, ataxia, and MRI tests indicating changes in white matter, and also in areas with no previous recorded cases of SD, as this disease may be underdiagnosed.

# Prenatal detection of free sialic acid storage disease: genetic and biochemical studies in nine families

Abstract: Sialic acid storage disorders, Salla disease (SD) and a severe infantile form of disease (ISSD), are recessively inherited allelic lysosomal storage disorders due to impaired egress of free sialic acid from lysosomes. Fourteen pregnancies at risk of adult‐type free sialic acid storage disease, SD, were monitored by sialic acid assays, genetic linkage or mutation detection analyses using chorionic villus samples. Three affected and 12 unaffected fetuses were identified. The first studies were based on the sialic acid assays alone, but the location of the gene enabled the use of genetic linkage analysis and, more recently, the identification of the SLC17A5 gene and disease‐causing mutations added yet another possibility for prenatal studies. A missense mutation 115C→T (R39C) is present in 95% of all Finnish SD alleles, providing an easy and reliable means of diagnostic studies. Both molecular and biochemical (sialic acid assay) studies can be used for prenatal diagnosis of free sialic acid storage diseases. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

# Free Sialic Acid Storage Disorders

Abstract: Clinical characteristics Free sialic acid storage disorders (FSASDs) are a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders resulting from increased lysosomal storage of free sialic acid. Historically, FSASD was divided into separate allelic disorders: Salla disease, intermediate severe Salla disease, and infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD). The mildest type was Salla disease, characterized by normal appearance and absence of neurologic findings at birth, followed by slowly progressive neurologic deterioration resulting in mild-to-moderate psychomotor delays, spasticity, athetosis, and epileptic seizures. Salla disease was named for a municipality in Finnish Lapland where a specific founder variant is relatively prevalent. However, the term Salla has been used in the literature to refer to less severe FSASD. More severe FSASD is historically referred to as ISSD, and is characterized by severe developmental delay, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiomegaly; death usually occurs in early childhood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a FSASD is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC17A5 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is symptomatic and supportive: standard treatment of seizures; feeding therapy and provision of adequate nutrition; rehabilitation to optimize mobility and communication; supplementation of calcium and vitamin D for low bone density; family and social support. Surveillance: Assessment of feeding, respiratory status, seizures, development, mobility, and nutrition with each visit. Regular evaluation by a rehabilitation specialist to identify potentially helpful interventions. Annual ECG and echocardiography for cardiomegaly. Genetic counseling The FSASDs are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

# The spectrum of SLC17A5-gene mutations resulting in free sialic acid-storage diseases indicates some genotype-phenotype correlation.

Abstract: Lysosomal free sialic acid-storage diseases include the allelic disorders Salla disease (SD) and infantile sialic acid-storage disease (ISSD). The defective gene, SLC17A5, coding for the lysosomal free sialic acid transporter was recently isolated by positional cloning. In the present study, we have identified a large number of mutations in SLC17A5 in patients presenting with either Salla disease or the ISSD phenotype. We also report for the first time the exon-intron boundaries of SLC17A5. All Finnish patients with SD (n=80) had a missense mutation changing a highly conserved arginine to cysteine (R39C); 91% of them were homozygotes for this old founder mutation. The compound-heterozygote patients, with the founder mutation in only one allele, presented with a more severe phenotype than did the homozygote patients. The same R39C mutation was also found both in most of the Swedish patients with SD and in a heterozygous form in five patients from central Europe who presented with an unusually severe (intermediate) SD phenotype. Ten different mutations, including deletions, insertions, and missense and nonsense mutations, were identified in patients with the most severe ISSD phenotype, most of whom were compound heterozygotes. Our results indicate some genotype-phenotype correlation in free sialic acid-storage diseases, suggesting that the phenotype associated with the homozygote R39C mutation is milder than that associated with other mutations.

# Varied Mechanisms Underlie the Free Sialic Acid Storage Disorders*♦

Abstract: Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of a lysosomal sialic acid transport activity and the resultant accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes. Genetic analysis of these diseases has identified several unique mutations in a single gene encoding a protein designated sialin (Verheijen, F. W., Verbeek, E., Aula, N., Beerens, C. E., Havelaar, A. C., Joosse, M., Peltonen, L., Aula, P., Galjaard, H., van der Spek, P. J., and Mancini, G. M. (1999) Nat. Genet. 23, 462–465; Aula, N., Salomaki, P., Timonen, R., Verheijen, F., Mancini, G., Mansson, J. E., Aula, P., and Peltonen, L. (2000) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 67, 832–840). From the biochemical phenotype of the diseases and the predicted polytopic structure of the protein, it has been suggested that sialin functions as a lysosomal sialic acid transporter. Here we directly demonstrate that this activity is mediated by sialin and that the recombinant protein has functional characteristics similar to the native lysosomal sialic acid transport system. Furthermore, we describe the effect of disease-causing mutations on the protein. We find that the majority of the mutations are associated with a complete loss of activity, while the mutations associated with the milder forms of the disease lead to reduced, but residual, function. Thus, there is a direct correlation between sialin function and the disease state. In addition, we find with one mutation that the protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that altered trafficking of sialin is also associated with disease. This analysis of the molecular mechanism of sialic acid storage disorders is a further step in identifying therapeutic approaches to these diseases.

# An Unusual Developmental Profile of Salla Disease in a Patient with the SallaFIN Mutation

Abstract: Salla disease (SD) is a disorder caused by defective storage of free sialic acid and results from mutations in the SLC17A5 gene. Early developmental delay of motor functions, and later cognitive skills, is typical. We describe a developmental profile of an unusual homozygous patient, who harboured the SallaFIN (p.R39C) mutation gene. The study involved neurological examination, neuropsychological investigation, and brain imaging. The neurocognitive findings were atypical in comparison with other patients with the SallaFIN mutation. Interestingly, there was no deterioration in the patient's neurological condition during adulthood. Her neurocognitive skills were remarkably higher than those of other patients with a conventional phenotype of SD. Our results suggest that the phenotype of SD is broad. Unidentified genetic or environmental variation might explain the unique SD type of this case.

# Quantification of free sialic acid in urine by HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry: a tool for the diagnosis of sialic acid storage disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND
Sialic acid storage diseases (SSDs) are severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders caused by a transport defect across the lysosomal membrane, which leads to accumulation of sialic acid in tissues, fibroblasts, and urine. Defective free sialic acid transport can be established by quantification of free sialic acid in urine.


METHODS
Urine sample size was adjusted to the equivalent of 100 nmol of creatinine. After addition of 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid as internal standard, samples were diluted with water to an end volume of 250 microL. We used 10 microL for HPLC-tandem mass spectrometric analysis in the negative electrospray ionization mode, monitoring transitions m/z 308.3-->m/z 86.9 (sialic acid) and m/z 267.2-->m/z 86.9 (internal standard). The overall method was validated and studied for ion suppression, interfering compounds, and pH effects. Samples from controls (n = 72) and SSD patients (n = 3) were analyzed.


RESULTS
The limit of detection was 3 micromol/L. Intraassay imprecision (CV; n = 10) was 6%, 3%, and 2% at 30, 130, and 1000 mmol/mol creatinine, respectively; corresponding interassay CV (n = 10) were 5%, 5%, and 2%. Recovery was 109% (100-1000 mmol/mol creatinine). The mean (SD) [range] excretion rates (mmol/mol creatinine) were 31.3 (16.6) [0.7-56.9] at 0-1 year (n = 20), 21.2 (9.8) [6.3-38.3] at 1-3 years (n = 15), 14.4 (8.2) [1.7-32.9] at 3-10 years (n = 25), and 4.6 (2.6) [0-9.8] above age 10 years (n = 12). SSD patients 1.2, 3.9, and 12 years of age had concentrations of 111.5, 54.2, and 36.1 mmol/mol creatinine, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
The HPLC-tandem MS method for free sialic acid in urine is more rapid, accurate, sensitive, selective, and robust than earlier methods and may serve as a candidate reference method for free sialic acid in diagnosis of SSD.

# An Italian severe Salla disease variant associated with a SLC17A5 mutation earlier described in infantile sialic acid storage disease

Abstract: The present study reports two Italian brothers affected by severe Salla disease (sialic acid storage disease), a slowly progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the Finnish population. Mutations of the SLC17A5 gene, which encodes a protein called sialin, are the primary cause of both Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD), a clinically distinct severe disorder. All Finnish patients with Salla disease show a R39C mutation. Both patients showed moderate intellectual disability, spastic ataxic syndrome, hypomyelination and cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lysosomal storage, all typical of Salla disease. Mutation analysis of the SLC17A5 gene in the younger brother revealed no R39C mutation, but a 15‐bp deletion in exon 6 on one of the alleles. This mutation is the same described in French‐Canadian patients with ISSD. Salla disease must be suspected in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation associated with ataxia and/or pyramidal symptoms, and MRI findings consistent with cerebral hypomyelination, irrespective of the patient's ethnic origin. A mutation screening based on R39C change does not exclude Salla disease outside Finland. Conversely, mutations found in ISSD can be expected, even in patients showing the Salla phenotype (e.g. symptoms at the milder end of the spectrum).

# Biochemical and molecular analyses of infantile free sialic acid storage disease in North American children

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of developmental delays and growth retardation in early childhood includes the allelic lysosomal sialic acid storage disorders, Salla disease and infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD). These diseases, due to defective free sialic acid transport out of lysosomes, derive from mutations in the SLC17A5 gene coding for the protein sialin. We present two patients with clinical, biochemical, and molecular data indicative of lysosomal free sialic acid storage disorders. One patient, with a severe clinical course typical of ISSD, had 86‐fold elevated levels of fibroblast free sialic acid, with 62% in the lysosomal fraction. His SLC17A5 mutations include a 148‐bp deletion of exon 9, due to a G > A splice site mutation in position 1 of intron 9, and a 15‐bp deletion (del 801–815) in exon 6. Another patient, with “intermediate severe” Salla disease, had 9‐fold elevated levels of free sialic acid in cultured fibroblasts, of which 87% resided in the lysosomal fraction. This girl is compound heterozygous for the SLC17A5 mutation commonly found in Finnish Salla disease patients (R39C) and a 15‐bp deletion found in ISSD patients (del 801–815).

# Central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction in the clinical variation of Salla disease

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the degree of possible peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement in addition to CNS manifestations in Salla disease, a free sialic acid storage disorder leading to severe mental retardation with a wide clinical variation. Background: Salla disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that affects the white matter of the CNS. MRI findings and recent 1H MRS study results provide evidence for delayed central myelination, but there is no previous evidence for PNS involvement in this disease. The gene coding for a presumptive sialic acid transport protein has recently been identified, and the first disease-causing mutations have been characterized. Methods: Nerve conduction studies; evoked potentials to visual (VEP), brainstem auditory (BAEP), and somatosensory stimuli (SEP); and EEG were carried out on 22 patients (age range 2 months to 57 years) with biochemically and genetically confirmed Salla disease. Brain MRI were available on 14 patients. Results: Nerve conduction studies revealed abnormalities in nearly half of the patients (10/21). The four severely disabled patients and the oldest patient had greatly reduced nerve conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. In addition, SEP was abnormal in the majority of the patients, but VEP and BAEP in only a few cases. PNS involvement was clearly associated with both the phenotypic severity and MRI findings. Conclusions: The results indicate that dysmyelination in Salla disease occurs not only in the CNS but also in the peripheral nervous system, contributing to the phenotypic variation, which can now be correlated with the molecular basis of the disease.

# Clinical, morphological, and molecular aspects of sialic acid storage disease manifesting in utero

Abstract: Background: Sialic acid storage diseases (SASDs) are caused by the defective transport of free sialic acid outside the lysosome. Apart from the Salla presentation in Finland, SASD is a very rare form of lysosomal storage disease (LSD) with approximately 35 cases, all diagnosed after birth, having been reported worldwide. We report a series of 12 French patients with very early manifestations, including eight fetuses diagnosed in utero. Results: Ultrasound examination, fetal autopsy, or clinical examination showed prominent ascites, rarely progressing to complete hydrops, and highlighted the early severity of bone disease. Dramatic increase of free sialic acid in various biological samples confirmed the diagnosis in all cases. Storage staining affinities and storage distribution in placenta and fetal organs allowed differential diagnosis from other LSDs but cannot differentiate between SASD, sialidosis, and galactosialidosis. Fourteen different mutations were identified, showing the molecular heterogeneity of SASD in the French population. We found that the previously described p.Y306X mutation generated two different transcripts, and we identified seven novel mutations: three deletions (del exon 7, del exons10+11 and c.1296delT), one splice site mutation (c.1350+1G→T) one nonsense mutation (p.W339X), and two missense mutations (p.R57C and p.G127E). Conclusions: The severity of our patients’ genotypes is in agreement with their phenotypes but not with the importance and early appearance of the very frequent in utero manifestations. Minimal fetal disease in some patients and a reported case of heterogeneity of fetal involvement within a family suggest that factors other than the genotype influence fetal manifestations.

# Hypogammaglobulinemia and imaging features in a patient with infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) and a novel mutation in the SLC17A5 gene

Abstract: Abstract Background Infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) is a severe multisystemic disorder characterized by the accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes. Case presentation The patient presented prenatally with fetal ascites and large scrotal hernias, without pleural or pericardial effusion. During the infantile period, he was diagnosed with permanent isolated immunoglobulin G (IgG) hypogammaglobulinemia, which thus far has rarely been associated with ISSD. The analysis of the SLC17A5 gene revealed a novel homozygous 94 bp gene deletion. We further provide a detailed description of pre- and postnatal clinical and radiographic findings. Conclusions Fetal ascites could be the first sign of several lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including ISSD. The analysis of LSD gene panels is an effective approach to diagnosis in the case of non-specific symptoms and when specific biochemical tests are not easily available.

# Neurocognitive profiles in Salla disease.

Abstract: Salla disease, a free sialic acid storage disorder, is one of the 36 currently known disorders in Finland that form the Finnish disease heritage. Salla disease leads to learning disability* with a wide clinical variation. Two main categories of the disease have been classified: a conventional subtype and a severe subtype with more severe defects. We present detailed neurocognitive profiles of 41 Finnish patients with Salla disease (19 females, 22 males; age range 11mo to 63y, median 19y). The neurocognitive development of patients with Salla disease was assessed by psychological and neuropsychological testing. All patients were also examined by a paediatric neurologist and a speech therapist. The characteristic cognitive profile consisted of a lower non-verbal performance (mean developmental age 13mo) compared with linguistic skills (mean developmental age 17mo). In particular, spatial and visual-constructive impairments were typical of these patients. Tactile and visual discrimination of forms was poor. Tasks demanding hand-eye coordination, maintenance of visual attention, and those requiring short-term visual memory and executive skills were performed better. Receptive language skills were notably better compared with expressive speech. The patients' interactive and non-verbal communication skills were quite strong. Another typical pattern with Salla disease was severe motor disability. After the second decade of life, the decline in these skills was more pronounced than patients' cognitive deterioration. Our results indicate that even though there is a considerable variation in the clinical findings of patients with Salla disease, the characteristic neurocognitive profile of the disease can be outlined.

# Clinical spectrum of infantile free sialic acid storage disease.

Abstract: Infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a lysosomal membrane transport defect, resulting in accumulation of free sialic acid within lysosomes. Only a few cases have been described. We report on three new cases of ISSD with different modes of presentation: an infant with nephrotic syndrome, a case of fetal and neonatal ascites with heart failure, and a case of fetal ascites with esophageal atresia type III. From these patients and a review of the literature (27 cases total) we draw the following conclusions. 1) "Coarse facies," fair complexion, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe psychomotor retardation are constant findings in this disorder. 2) Nephrotic syndrome occurred in most cases (four in seven) in which renal evaluation was performed. Therefore, ISSD is an important cause of nephrosis in infants with a storage disorder phenotype. 3) Fetal/neonatal ascites or hydrops was the mode of presentation in 13 (60%) of 21 cases. Thus, ISSD enters in the differential diagnosis of hydrops fetalis with a storage disease phenotype. 4) Cardiomegaly was evident in nine cases. 5) Corneae were always clear, and albinoid fundi were reported in five cases. 6) Dysostosis multiplex was not prominent. 7) Bone marrow aspiration could be negative. 8) Death ensued in early infancy with a mean age of 13.1 months. All reported deaths were caused by respiratory infections.

# Prenatal diagnosis of free sialic acid storage disorders (SASD)

Abstract: Free sialic acid storage disorders, Salla disease (SD) and Infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD), are lysosomal storage diseases due to impaired function of a sialic acid transporter, sialin, at the lysosomal membrane. Several mutations of the sialin gene, SLC17A5, are known, leading either to the severe neonatal/infantile disease or to the milder, adult‐type developmental disorder, Salla disease. Free sialic acid accumulation in lysosomes causes increased tissue concentration and consequently elevated urinary excretion. Prenatal diagnosis of SASD is possible either by determination of free sialic acid concentration or by mutation analysis of the SLC17A5 gene in fetal specimen, in chorionic villus biopsy particularly. Both techniques have been successfully applied in several cases, sialic acid assay more often in ISSD cases but mutation analysis preferentially in SD. Sialic acid assay of amniotic fluid supernatant or cultured amniotic fluid cells may give erroneous results and should not be used for prenatal diagnosis of these disorders. The present comments are mainly based on our experience of prenatal diagnosis of SD in Finnish families. A founder mutation in SLC17A5 gene, 115C‐> T, represents 95% of the disease alleles in the Finnish SD patients, which provides a unique possibility to apply mutation analysis. Therefore, molecular studies have successfully been used in 17 families since the identification of the gene and the characterization of the SD mutations. Earlier, eight prenatal studies were performed by measuring the free sialic acid concentration in chorionic villus samples. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

# Free sialic acid storage (Salla) disease in Sweden

Abstract: The first 23 patients diagnosed with Salla disease in Sweden are presented. A high incidence of the “Finnish” R39C mutation, together with genealogical data, indicates that a large proportion of the mutations are of Finnish origin. All patients had pathologically high levels of free sialic acid in urine and in fibroblasts. The clinical picture confirms what has already been reported from Finland, with early psychomotor retardation, ataxia and speech problems. One‐third of the patients had epilepsy.
