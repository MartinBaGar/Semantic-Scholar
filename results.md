# Hypoxic culture induces expression of sialin, a sialic acid transporter, and cancer-associated gangliosides containing non-human sialic acid on human cancer cells

## Abstract

Tumor hypoxia figures heavily in malignant progression by altering the intracellular glucose metabolism and inducing angiogenic factor production, thus, selecting and expanding more aggressive cancer cell clones. Little is known, however, regarding hypoxia-induced antigenic changes in cancers. We investigated the expression of N-glycolyl sialic acid (NeuGc)-G(M2), a cancer-associated ganglioside containing non-human sialic acid, NeuGc, in human cancers. Cancer tissues prepared from patients with colon cancers frequently expressed NeuGc-G(M2), whereas it was virtually absent in nonmalignant colonic epithelia. Studies on cultured cancer cells indicated that the non-human sialic acid was incorporated from culture medium. Hypoxic culture markedly induced mRNA for a sialic acid transporter, sialin, and this accompanied enhanced incorporation of NeuGc as well as N-acetyl sialic acid. Transfection of cells with sialin gene conferred accelerated sialic acid transport and induced cell surface expression of NeuGc-G(M2). We propose that the preferential expression of NeuGc-G(M2) in cancers is closely associated with tumor hypoxia. Hypoxic culture of tumor cells induces expression of the sialic acid transporter, and enhances the incorporation of non-human sialic acid from the external milieu. A consequence of this is the acquisition of cancer-associated cell surface gangliosides, typically G(M2), containing non-human sialic acid (NeuGc), which is not endogenously synthesized through CMP-N-acetyl sialic acid hydroxylase because humans lack the gene for the synthetic enzyme. As hypoxia is associated with diminished response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, NeuGc-G(M2) is a potential therapeutic target for hypoxic cancer cells.

# Sialin (SLC17A5) functions as a nitrate transporter in the plasma membrane

## Abstract

In vivo recycling of nitrate (NO3−) and nitrite (NO2−) is an important alternative pathway for the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and maintenance of systemic nitrate–nitrite–NO balance. More than 25% of the circulating NO3− is actively removed and secreted by salivary glands. Oral commensal bacteria convert salivary NO3− to NO2−, which enters circulation and leads to NO generation. The transporters for NO3− in salivary glands have not yet been identified. Here we report that sialin (SLC17A5), mutations in which cause Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder (ISSD), functions as an electrogenic 2NO3−/H+ cotransporter in the plasma membrane of salivary gland acinar cells. We have identified an extracellular pH-dependent anion current that is carried by NO3− or sialic acid (SA), but not by Br−, and is accompanied by intracellular acidification. Both responses were reduced by knockdown of sialin expression and increased by the plasma membrane-targeted sialin mutant (L22A-L23A). Fibroblasts from patients with ISSD displayed reduced SA- and NO3−-induced currents compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, expression of disease-associated sialin mutants in fibroblasts and salivary gland cells suppressed the H+-dependent NO3− conductance. Importantly, adenovirus-dependent expression of the sialinH183R mutant in vivo in pig salivary glands decreased NO3− secretion in saliva after intake of a NO3−-rich diet. Taken together, these data demonstrate that sialin mediates nitrate influx into salivary gland and other cell types. We suggest that the 2NO3−/H+ transport function of sialin in salivary glands can contribute significantly to clearance of serum nitrate, as well as nitrate recycling and physiological nitrite-NO homeostasis.

# Lysosomes Are the Major Vesicular Compartment Undergoing Ca2+-Regulated Exocytosis from Cortical Astrocytes

## Abstract

Although Ca2+-dependent exocytosis is considered to be a pathway for gliotransmitter release from astrocytes, the structural and functional bases of this process remain controversial. We studied the relationship between near-membrane Ca2+ elevations and the dynamics of single astroglial vesicles with styryl (FM) dyes. We show that cultured astrocytes, unlike neurons, spontaneously internalize FM dyes, resulting in the labeling of the entire acidic vesicle population within minutes. Interestingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation did not affect the FM labeling. Most FM-stained vesicles expressed sialin, CD63/LAMP3, and VAMP7, three markers for lysosomes and late endosomes. A subset of lysosomes underwent asynchronous exocytosis that required both Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Lysosomal fusion occurred within seconds and was complete with no evidence for kiss and run. Our experiments suggest that astroglial Ca2+-regulated exocytosis is carried by lysosomes and operates on a timescale orders of magnitude slower than synaptic transmission.

# Nitrate and Nitrite in Health and Disease

## Abstract

The source of dietary nitrate (NO3) is mainly green, leafy vegetables, partially absorbed into blood through intestinal mucosa. The recycled nitrate is reabsorbed and concentrated by the salivary glands and then secreted into saliva. In 2012, sialin was first discovered as the mammalian membrane nitrate transporter in salivary glands and plays a key role in circulation of inorganic nitrate, providing a scientific basis for further investigation into the circulation and functions of nitrate. Dietary nitrate can be converted to nitrite (NO2) by oral commensal bacteria under the tongue or in the stomach, following which nitrite is converted to nitric oxide (NO) through non-enzymatic synthesis. Previously, nitrate and nitrite were thought to be carcinogenic due to the potential formation of nitrogen compounds, whereas the beneficial functions of NO3--NO2--NO pathway were ignored. Under conditions of hypoxia and ischemia, the production of endogenous NO from L-arginine is inhibited, while the activity of exogenous NO3--NO2--NO is enhanced. Recently, a greater amount of evidence has shown that nitrate and nitrite serve as a reservoir and perform positive biological NO-like functions. Therefore, exogenous dietary nitrate plays an important role in various physiological activities as an effective supplement of nitrite and NO in human body. Here we generally review the source, circulation and bio-functions of dietary nitrate.

# Lysosomal membrane proteins

## Abstract

The lysosomal system is the main intracellular mechanism for the turnover of endogenous and exogenous macromolecules. This catabolism is brought about in the lumen of lysosomes by a cocktail of predominantly hydrolytic enzymes with characteristic acidic pH-optima. The lysosomal membrane, which has a typical single phospholipid bilayer, controls the passage of material into and out of lysosomes, by its permeability and ability to fuse with digestive vacuoles or engulf cytosolic material. About 20 systems for transporting small molecules across the lysosomal membrane have been characterized but only two proteins, cystinosin and sialin, involved in the transport of cystine and sialic acid, respectively, have been cloned. A distinct, vacuolar proton pump (V-type H+ ATPase), which maintains the low luminal pH, has been characterized. Ubiquitous, highly glycosylated, integral membrane proteins of largely unknown function, called lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPS) or lysosomal integral membrane proteins (LIMPS), account for about 50% of the protein in the lysosomal membrane. They have a short cytosolic domain of 10-20 amino acids containing single tyrosine or di-leucine motifs, which interact with adaptor complexes (APS) for sorting at the trans-Golgi network and targeting to lysosomes. A deficiency of LAMP-2 is the primary defect in Danon disease. Other proteins associate with the membrane transiently or cell-specifically. The structure, function and intracellular transport of these different classes of lysosomal membrane proteins will be reviewed.

# Identification of a vesicular aspartate transporter

## Abstract

Aspartate is an excitatory amino acid that is costored with glutamate in synaptic vesicles of hippocampal neurons and synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) of pinealocytes and is exocytosed and stimulates neighboring cells by binding to specific cell receptors. Although evidence increasingly supports the occurrence of aspartergic neurotransmission, this process is still debated because the mechanism for the vesicular storage of aspartate is unknown. Here, we show that sialin, a lysosomal H+/sialic acid cotransporter, is present in hippocampal synaptic vesicles and pineal SLMVs. RNA interference of sialin expression decreased exocytosis of aspartate and glutamate in pinealocytes. Proteoliposomes containing purified sialin actively accumulated aspartate and glutamate to a similar extent when inside positive membrane potential is imposed as the driving force. Sialin carrying a mutation found in people suffering from Salla disease (R39C) was completely devoid of aspartate and glutamate transport activity, although it retained appreciable H+/sialic acid cotransport activity. These results strongly suggest that sialin possesses dual physiological functions and acts as a vesicular aspartate/glutamate transporter. It is possible that people with Salla disease lose aspartergic (and also the associated glutamatergic) neurotransmission, and this could provide an explanation for why Salla disease causes severe neurological defects.

# Human skeletal muscle nitrate store: influence of dietary nitrate supplementation and exercise

## Abstract

Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator and a regulator of many physiological processes, is produced in mammals both enzymatically and by reduction of nitrite and nitrate ions. We have previously reported that, in rodents, skeletal muscle serves as a nitrate reservoir, with nitrate levels greatly exceeding those in blood or other internal organs, and with nitrate being reduced to NO during exercise. In the current study, we show that nitrate concentration is substantially greater in skeletal muscle than in blood and is elevated further by dietary nitrate ingestion in human volunteers. We also show that high‐intensity exercise results in a reduction in the skeletal muscle nitrate store following supplementation, likely as a consequence of its reduction to nitrite and NO. We also report the presence of sialin, a nitrate transporter, and xanthine oxidoreductase in human skeletal muscle, indicating that muscle has the necessary apparatus for nitrate transport, storage and metabolism.

# Varied Mechanisms Underlie the Free Sialic Acid Storage Disorders*♦

## Abstract

Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disorder are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of a lysosomal sialic acid transport activity and the resultant accumulation of free sialic acid in lysosomes. Genetic analysis of these diseases has identified several unique mutations in a single gene encoding a protein designated sialin (Verheijen, F. W., Verbeek, E., Aula, N., Beerens, C. E., Havelaar, A. C., Joosse, M., Peltonen, L., Aula, P., Galjaard, H., van der Spek, P. J., and Mancini, G. M. (1999) Nat. Genet. 23, 462–465; Aula, N., Salomaki, P., Timonen, R., Verheijen, F., Mancini, G., Mansson, J. E., Aula, P., and Peltonen, L. (2000) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 67, 832–840). From the biochemical phenotype of the diseases and the predicted polytopic structure of the protein, it has been suggested that sialin functions as a lysosomal sialic acid transporter. Here we directly demonstrate that this activity is mediated by sialin and that the recombinant protein has functional characteristics similar to the native lysosomal sialic acid transport system. Furthermore, we describe the effect of disease-causing mutations on the protein. We find that the majority of the mutations are associated with a complete loss of activity, while the mutations associated with the milder forms of the disease lead to reduced, but residual, function. Thus, there is a direct correlation between sialin function and the disease state. In addition, we find with one mutation that the protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that altered trafficking of sialin is also associated with disease. This analysis of the molecular mechanism of sialic acid storage disorders is a further step in identifying therapeutic approaches to these diseases.

# From Nitrate to Nitric Oxide

## Abstract

The salivary glands and oral bacteria play an essential role in the conversion process from nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) to nitric oxide (NO) in the human body. NO is, at present, recognized as a multifarious messenger molecule with important vascular and metabolic functions. Besides the endogenous L-arginine pathway, which is catalyzed by complex NO synthases, nitrate in food contributes to the main extrinsic generation of NO through a series of sequential steps (NO3--NO2--NO pathway). Up to 25% of nitrate in circulation is actively taken up by the salivary glands, and as a result, its concentration in saliva can increase 10- to 20-fold. However, the mechanism has not been clearly illustrated until recently, when sialin was identified as an electrogenic 2NO3-/H+ transporter in the plasma membrane of salivary acinar cells. Subsequently, the oral bacterial species located at the posterior part of the tongue reduce nitrate to nitrite, as catalyzed by nitrate reductase enzymes. These bacteria use nitrate and nitrite as final electron acceptors in their respiration and meanwhile help the host to convert nitrate to NO as the first step. This review describes the role of salivary glands and oral bacteria in the metabolism of nitrate and in the maintenance of NO homeostasis. The potential therapeutic applications of oral inorganic nitrate and nitrite are also discussed.

# Is Aspartate an Excitatory Neurotransmitter?

## Abstract

Recent evidence has resurrected the idea that the amino acid aspartate, a selective NMDA receptor agonist, is a neurotransmitter. Using a mouse that lacks the glutamate-selective vesicular transporter VGLUT1, we find that glutamate alone fully accounts for the activation of NMDA receptors at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. This excludes a role for aspartate and, by extension, a recently proposed role for the sialic acid transporter sialin in excitatory transmission. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It has been proposed that the amino acid aspartate serves as a neurotransmitter. Although aspartate is a selective agonist for NMDA receptors, we find that glutamate alone fully accounts for neurotransmission at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, excluding a role for aspartate.
